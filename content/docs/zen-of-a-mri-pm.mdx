## Start to learn English

Like many scientific technologies, if you start learning English early, the long-term benefits are substantial. It may feel difficult and unfamiliar at first, but as you delve deeper into technical studies, you'll increasingly realize the importance of English learning.

The rapid development of AI and LLM technologies has led many to mistakenly believe that "English is not important." However, after frequent use of LLMs, you'll discover the true significance of English.

Future documentation will take two different forms - one for humans, and one for AI. (AI can read human-oriented documentation well, but the reading experience for humans with AI-oriented documentation will be poor.)

The vast majority of technical documentation, the latest technical articles, and literature will still be in English.

## Don't limit yourself

You can't know your most interesting research areas and directions at the beginning, nor do you know which way to go in the maze of MRI knowledge. So don't set limits for yourself from the start; maintain curiosity about various aspects of knowledge.

## First principles

> The Tao begets One; One begets Two; Two begets Three; Three begets all things.
> 
> —— Laozi, "Tao Te Ching"

Emphasize the study of fundamental disciplines. What ultimately limits your height and achievement is your level of expertise in mathematics, physics, computer science, and basic medical sciences (anatomy, physiology, pathology, histology, genetics). Many people hit a learning ceiling due to insufficient knowledge in these foundational subjects.
For example, many people struggle to understand MRI, not because they don't understand quantum mechanics, but because they've forgotten their knowledge of trigonometric functions.

## Learn to use the internet and office software

- Learn how to connect and use Google on your own
- Learn to use the Chrome browser and install useful extensions
- Essential knowledge of office software usage
- If possible, learn Markdown syntax and Markdown editors

## Master structured writing

It will make you quick-witted and fluent when taking notes and writing product documentation.

## Apply MRI principles (philosophy) to learn MRI

- Calculus thinking: Any big difficulty can be broken down into small efforts, small attempts, and small progress
- Fourier transform thinking: The principle of symmetry, the beauty of physics
